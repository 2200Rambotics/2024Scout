# Scouting2200

A scouting application made by Team 2200 to help track robot activity during a match. Uses a QR code containing tab-separated values to allow for a QR code scanner to instantly read the data into a spreadsheet.

Made with Flutter, the most recent layout is for FRC 2023-2024 (Crescendo).
